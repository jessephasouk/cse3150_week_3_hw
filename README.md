# cse3150_week_3_hw

In this program I used pointers to dynamically allocate memory for student names and to update GPA values through function. When I took in an input for student name, I first took the string length of the input after converting it to a C string with c.str(). Then I found its length by using strlen() and adding 1 to it for the null terminator for strings. In the function definitions const was used to protect things like name of student when printing out the student info and for printing out the average GPA adding const to the array of GPAs. In this same function after we output, when printed the value returned is then casted to a integer as per instructions using static_cast<int>(value). For each function that needed to throw exceptions it would check for when by using if-else statments, were we would throw a error like index out of range or having a full list. After throwing the messsage of error we use catch() to then print out this error to the user.
